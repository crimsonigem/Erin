# Harvard iGEM 2017 Week 4 (6/26 - 6/30)

## Procedural Development

### Datsenko-Wanner
In accordance to the Datsenko-Wanner protocol specified in last week's writeup, this week we designed appropriate primers for the intended knockout parts:

1. The native curli genes in the BL21(DE3) strain
2. List of proteins that would not affect the viability of the cells (such as signaling mechanisms or exotoxin secretions). This list was gathered by looking through a database of *E.coli* proteins, then making sure that the parts had not already been deleted from BL21(DE3).

However in our weekly meeting a good point was brought up that we should not delay progressing with the main point of the project by being held up with "optimization" of the *E.coli*, especially because BL21(DE3) has already been extensively optimized. Therefore we decided to hold off on this for now, and to focus on finding the optimal ratio of the csg proteins.

### RBS Library screening
As specified in the Week 3 writeup, we finalized the procedure for the combinatorial screening of RBS. This involved making a spreadsheet of the various combinations we would have to make, as well as determining a general timeline for the intended experiment. <br>
In the first part of the experiment, we decided to find the best ratio of csgA and csgG by doing combinatorial MoClo analysis. Upon having identified the best RBS for the two, we would proceed with optimizing csgE, C, and the sec complex (of which all the subunits would be under the same RBS assuming 1:1:1:1 stoichiometry).

## Wiki Development
This week we also submitted our project proposal and safety sheet. Since our project proposal was to be posted on our team wiki, Hyeon-jae and I also spent time to create the skeleton for our website. This included deciding on a theme, and the general vision for how we wanted to showcase our project. <br>
We forsee that we would add to the wiki little by little as the weeks go by as we would have more concrete writeups to post under the appropriate sections.
